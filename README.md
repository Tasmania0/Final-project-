This Repository contain our final project for Artifitial Intellegence course files.
Our project uses pyhon scripts, Artifical Intellegence methods, and data mining techniques; To simulate silica sand production line data. Using visual code, Roboflow, and orange applications.

The project is devided to four parts:
1- Silica particles recognition through image processing.
2- Silic Sand microscopic washing data analysis.
3- Sand sample origin and different uses predection from microscopic data.
4- Smart visual Fire detection in the production line.
